var posts_values = [{"book_title":["A Monster Calls"],"book_author":["Patrick Ness"],"review_body":"\n      One of the most beautiful books ever, in images and in prose. I started out thinking this was some sort of horror stories, but it turned out to be one of the best fairy tales, with beautiful twists in the monster's stories. It is also sad, heartbreaking, and Connor.... awwww, I just want to hug him. A great read for children. And for adults too, if you want to travel into stories and into imagination. \n  ","rating":["3"]},{"book_title":["The Bell Jar"],"book_author":["Sylvia Plath"],"review_body":"\n      OMG.... Why have I never discovered this book before?<br /><br />I feel like Esther Greenwood, ambitious and too full of hope and torn between the many branches of life. Sometimes the circumstances of life force me to go against my creativity and abort my passion which turned me insane, the way people do not fully appreciate what I have been through depressed me so much. The Bell Jar reflects a lot of things inside of me, a perfectionist who is devastated by errors and contained a lot of self-doubts and try to adapt into the social's image. <br /><br />Love this book, recommend to everyone :D <br /><br /><br /><br />\n  ","rating":["5"]}]
