Everyone in this novel felt so real, from their little tiny habit to their temperament to their quotes, that you cannot helped but feel empathizing with them. They seem to you like long lost friends that are heading towards an unstoppable tragedy and you can do nothing except watching them unravel into a mess as they try to helplessly rationalize themselves out of it. <br /><br /><i> Some people are little Chernobyls, shimmering with silent, spreading poison: get anywhere near them and every breath you take will wreck you from the inside out.” </i> <br /><br /><b> My favorite of course is Cassie Maddox </b>. You can see how she try to keep her shit together working as an undercover, how she want to belong to these people, how she admire their esoteric knowledge on literature, their closeness, and their warmth but at the same time she had to coldly work out who, out of all these seemingly charming and intelligent literature student, is the murderer. And gosh, Daniel March. Rational, cold, intense. I love his rant on society, politics, economy, his obsession with an ideal and the extend of which he sacrificed himself to it. <br /><br /><b> - The atmosphere </b>: Tana French once said in her interview that she doesn't care much for the gory detail when it comes to detective novels, but she want to scare us psychologically, and French does an amazing job in that. I hate detective novels that are too focused on the technical details, while their characters are bland and nothing more than a plot device. In French's novels, she show how beautiful human beings are just as how cruel they can be. Everything is not as seem and the reader, like like Cassie Maddox, is constantly oscillating between wanting to suspect someone yet at the same time not wanting to suspect them. This ambiguity when it came to actions, words, and morality is what make The Likeness unique. <br /><br /><b> - Lastly, the prose: </b> This woman is a master with words. Ditch that stupid 50 shades of Grey lame ass repetitiveness and 5 year old vocabulary, take up some French novels instead. Tana really showed how she can hurt you with her words and make you fall in love with them. <br /><br /><i> \"The idea was flawed, of course. Innately and fatally flawed. It depended on two of the human race's greatest myths: the possibility of permanence, and the simplicity of human nature. Both of which are all well and good in literature, but the purest fantasy outside the covers of a book. Our story should have stopped that night with the cold cocoa, the night we moved in: and they all lived happily ever after, the end. Inconveniently, however, real life demanded that we keep on living.” </i>\n  ","rating":["5"],"date":"Dec 29 2018"},{"book_title":"The Fountainhead","book_synopsis":"","book_author":"Ayn Rand","review_body":"\n      <b> Do not mistaken my four-star rating as an unbounded admiration for Rand. </b> In truth, I am far from being an Objectivist, and there are parts of this philosophy which I personally condemn. However, if one allow oneself to be an objective reader and carefully examine the works of Ayn Rand, one realize how profound some of her quotes and ideas are. This novel is controversial, but again, every works that touch the depth of humanity and expose the horrendous society cannot escape from controversy. So, as a list, I will summarize my feelings for this novel as follow:<br /><br /><b> The Good: </b> Individual must not conform to society. When a man creates and lives, he does not live for the expectation of others or allow his thoughts and identity to be dictated by others, but must strive for his own path <b> (Nietzsche, anyone?) </b>. Like most Ayn Rand's novel, this beautiful individualism is expressed, though sometimes didactically, with beautiful and poetic descriptions. Who could not feel for the struggle of our own soul against the unjust society? Who could not sympathize with the lonely hero amidst the unappreciated mass? And that is why, while the plot itself does not have much action, it is worthy to savor because of its brilliant quotes. <br /><br /><b> Gail Wynand </b>: I have an unbound admiration for this character, I even devote an entire paper on analyzing his personality. I think Wynand is a fresh breath in the black and white world of Ayn Rand. While we all know how awesome Roark is, he is seriously a piece of <b> stone </b>: deadly boring and have no emotional reaction against conflicts or anything at all. Seriously, he is a Gary Stu, like all Randian heroes are. Gail Wyannd, on the other hand, embodied the conflict between the desire to live according to one's ideology and the need to submit oneself to society's desire. He is just brilliant, witty, half saint, half demon, and who could seriously not empathize with the disgust he felt for himself? If Gail Wynand was not in this novel, I would have lower the rating, but God, the entire part under his point of view is just so really, really, really good. <br /><br /><b> Peter Keating </b>: Also another very brilliant character. He represents ourselves in our weakest moment, the parasite the sticks to a social group to feel more powerful, the second-hander that imitates social acts just to feel cooler. Peter Keating's eventual decay probably proves to be one of the most memorable part of the story. Who could not feel for him when he turned to Roark, with baleful eyes, and showcase his own painting knowing that it was too late to redeem himself. And plus, the entire conversation at the end of the novel with Toohey is just wowowowowoowow. Like I seriously love it more than Roark's dramatic speech at the trial. Toohey just seriously says what the fuck is wrong with our society today: the promises of salvation, the \"enshrining of mediocrity\", the turning every man's thoughts into the same current so that no deviation and individualism have its chance to rise again. <br /><br /><b> Character </b>: Okay, other than the aforementioned, I really have a problem with Ayn Rand's Character, such as Roark and Toohey, since they are <b> UNREALISTIC </b>. But taking this novel as a work of art, I would consider them interesting though I sincerely thought nobody spoke the way Toohey does (too prosey) or how some characters just understand each other's train of thoughts immediately.<br /><br /><b> Ayn Rand can be a total dick sometimes, but give her a try. </b> There are some enlightening moments in there that overshadow her dickery. As a 15 year old, I was easily enchanted by her philosophy, but now at the ripe age of 18, I sometimes remind myself that the world isn't divided into black and white, and that extremism of anything won't do much good to one's soul and the society. And so, to finish this, I give you one of my favorite quote: <br /><br /><b> <i> I stand at the end of no tradition. I may, perhaps, stand at the beginning of one </i> </b>.\n  ","rating":["4"],"date":"Dec 29 2018"}]
