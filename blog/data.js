However, if one allow oneself to be an objective reader and carefully examine the works of Ayn Rand, one realize how profound some of her quotes and ideas are. This novel is controversial, but again, every works that touch the depth of humanity and expose the horrendous society cannot escape from controversy. So, as a list, I will summarize my feelings for this novel as follow:<br /><br /><b> The Good: </b> Individual must not conform to society. When a man creates and lives, he does not live for the expectation of others or allow his thoughts and identity to be dictated by others, but must strive for his own path <b> (Nietzsche, anyone?) </b>. Like most Ayn Rand's novel, this beautiful individualism is expressed, though sometimes didactically, with beautiful and poetic descriptions. Who could not feel for the struggle of our own soul against the unjust society? Who could not sympathize with the lonely hero amidst the unappreciated mass? And that is why, while the plot itself does not have much action, it is worthy to savor because of its brilliant quotes. <br /><br /><b> Gail Wynand </b>: I have an unbound admiration for this character, I even devote an entire paper on analyzing his personality. I think Wynand is a fresh breath in the black and white world of Ayn Rand. While we all know how awesome Roark is, he is seriously a piece of <b> stone </b>: deadly boring and have no emotional reaction against conflicts or anything at all. Seriously, he is a Gary Stu, like all Randian heroes are. Gail Wyannd, on the other hand, embodied the conflict between the desire to live according to one's ideology and the need to submit oneself to society's desire. He is just brilliant, witty, half saint, half demon, and who could seriously not empathize with the disgust he felt for himself? If Gail Wynand was not in this novel, I would have lower the rating, but God, the entire part under his point of view is just so really, really, really good. <br /><br /><b> Peter Keating </b>: Also another very brilliant character. He represents ourselves in our weakest moment, the parasite the sticks to a social group to feel more powerful, the second-hander that imitates social acts just to feel cooler. Peter Keating's eventual decay probably proves to be one of the most memorable part of the story. Who could not feel for him when he turned to Roark, with baleful eyes, and showcase his own painting knowing that it was too late to redeem himself. And plus, the entire conversation at the end of the novel with Toohey is just wowowowowoowow. Like I seriously love it more than Roark's dramatic speech at the trial. Toohey just seriously says what the fuck is wrong with our society today: the promises of salvation, the \"enshrining of mediocrity\", the turning every man's thoughts into the same current so that no deviation and individualism have its chance to rise again. <br /><br /><b> Character </b>: Okay, other than the aforementioned, I really have a problem with Ayn Rand's Character, such as Roark and Toohey, since they are <b> UNREALISTIC </b>. But taking this novel as a work of art, I would consider them interesting though I sincerely thought nobody spoke the way Toohey does (too prosey) or how some characters just understand each other's train of thoughts immediately.<br /><br /><b> Ayn Rand can be a total dick sometimes, but give her a try. </b> There are some enlightening moments in there that overshadow her dickery. As a 15 year old, I was easily enchanted by her philosophy, but now at the ripe age of 18, I sometimes remind myself that the world isn't divided into black and white, and that extremism of anything won't do much good to one's soul and the society. And so, to finish this, I give you one of my favorite quote: <br /><br /><b> <i> I stand at the end of no tradition. I may, perhaps, stand at the beginning of one </i> </b>.\n  ","rating":["4"],"date":"Dec 29 2018"}]
