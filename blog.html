                The because-I'm-worth-it shower (<i>Looking for someone tall, slim, very fit, no smokers, no drugs, no kids, no pets, must have a full time job and own car, must like fusion cuisine, speak at least three languages, enjoy bikram yoga and acid jazz...</i>) is just as bad: ordering their relationships from the online menu because of course you have to have one, same as you have to have the state-of-the-art sound system and a pimped-out new car... No one <i> needs </i> a relationship. The truth is, if you don't exist without someone else, you don't exist at all. <br>

            <p class="quote"> "Some people see a magic trick and say, "Impossible!" They clap their hands, turn over their money, and forget about it ten minutes later. Other people ask how it worked. They go home, get into bed, toss and turn, wondering how it was done. It takes them a good night's sleep to forget all about it. And then there are the ones who stay awake, running through the trick again and again, looking for that skip in perception, the crack in the illusion that will explain how their eyes got duped; they're the kind who won't rest until they've mastered that little bit of mystery for themselves. I'm that kind.” <br>

            <h2> On Bojack Horseman </h2>
            <h3> The most enlightened, depressing cartoon I've ever watched</h3>
            <h4> Published: 17 December 2018 | tags: bookreviews</h4>
            <!-- <img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.forcesofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/BoJackHorseman_p021.jpg?resize=800%2C413" /> -->
            <p class="quote"> "Closure is a made up thing by Steven Spielberg to sell movie tickets. It, like true love and the Munich Olympics, doesn’t exist in the real world. The only thing to do now is just to keep living forward." </p>
            <p class="notes">
                I thought Rick and Morty, created by the legendary Dan Harmon himself, was pretty depressing for an animated series. But Bojack Horseman had to steal the award for the feel-bad cartoon of its time. Accompanied with satirical dark humor, this is a mastery composite of critiques on society, the superficiality of Hollywood, and the unending escape of the ego.
